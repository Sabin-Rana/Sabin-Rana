Enterprise AWS 3-tier infrastructure designed and validated through Terraform, demonstrating professional DevOps practices with strategic cost governance. This methodology emerged from real experience with cloud costs and provides a practical path for learning cloud infrastructure on a budget.

### Technical Focus:
- **Enterprise Architecture**: 57 AWS resources across 6 Terraform modules
- **Zero-Cost Validation**: Comprehensive testing without deployment expenses  
- **Safety-First Framework**: 7 automation scripts for cost control and emergency protocols
- **Multi-AZ High Availability**: Enterprise resilience with full observability
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Complete CI/CD, monitoring, and security implementation

**Technical Stack:**
**Infrastructure:** Terraform, AWS (VPC, ALB, RDS, EC2, CloudWatch)
**Applications:** Node.js, React, PostgreSQL, Docker
**DevOps:** GitHub Actions, CI/CD Pipelines, Security Scanning

Building on my 3-tier architecture expertise, this project demonstrates modern serverless patterns with enhanced compliance monitoring. Following the same rigorous zero-cost validation methodology to ensure financial responsibility while mastering enterprise serverless architecture.

### Technical Focus:
- **Serverless Architecture**: Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, Cognito, CloudFront
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform modules for 35+ AWS resources
- **Compliance and Security**: AWS Config rules design, drift detection patterns
- **Zero-Cost Validation**: Local testing with SAM CLI, Terraform planning only
- **Enterprise Patterns**: Multi-tenant design, authentication, monitoring

## Terraform Infrastructure Automation Journey
Completed a 10-day structured Terraform learning journey, automating end-to-end AWS infrastructure through Infrastructure as Code.  
This project represents my transition from manual AWS console deployments to fully automated, production-ready architectures.  
The implementation includes reusable Terraform modules, remote state management, CI/CD patterns, and security automation demonstrating real-world scalability and reliability.  

**Repository:** [AWS Infrastructure Automation with Terraform](https://github.com/Sabin-Rana/terraform-learning-journey)

## Foundational AWS Projects (Pre-Terraform)

Before adopting Infrastructure as Code, I deployed multiple AWS architectures manually through the console with comprehensive documentation.

### Enterprise 3-Tier Architecture
[View Repository](https://github.com/Sabin-Rana/aws-3tier-architecture)  
Three-tier web application with high availability, auto scaling, and multi-AZ database configuration. Comprehensive documentation with over 115 implementation steps.  
**Stack:** VPC, Application Load Balancer, EC2 Auto Scaling, RDS Multi-AZ, CloudWatch, SNS

### Serverless Student Management System
[View Repository](https://github.com/Sabin-Rana/aws-serverless-architecture-showcase)  
Serverless web application with full CRUD functionality, API integration, and global content delivery.  
**Stack:** Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3, CloudFront, IAM

### Secure VPC Network Architecture
[View Repository](https://github.com/Sabin-Rana/aws-vpc-network-isolation)  
Enterprise network design featuring public/private subnet isolation, NAT Gateway, and layered security controls.  
**Stack:** VPC, Subnets, NAT Gateway, Security Groups, NACLs, Route Tables
