A complete enterprise-grade AWS infrastructure designed and validated through Terraform, demonstrating professional DevOps practices with absolute cost control. This project represents my evolution from manual deployments to automated infrastructure as code.

### Key Achievements:
- **57 AWS Resources** validated across 6 Terraform modules
- **Zero-Cost Validation** - Complete infrastructure testing without deployment
- **Safety-First Approach** - 7 automation scripts for cost management
- **Production-Ready** - Full CI/CD, monitoring, and security
- **Multi-AZ Architecture** - High availability with comprehensive monitoring

### Technologies:
- **Infrastructure**: Terraform, AWS (VPC, ALB, RDS, EC2, CloudWatch)
- **Applications**: Node.js, React, PostgreSQL, Docker
- **DevOps**: GitHub Actions, CI/CD, Security Scanning

## Terraform Infrastructure Automation Journey

Completed a 10-day structured Terraform learning journey, automating end-to-end AWS infrastructure through Infrastructure as Code.  
This project represents my transition from manual AWS console deployments to fully automated, production-ready architectures.  

The implementation includes reusable Terraform modules, remote state management, CI/CD patterns, and security automation  demonstrating real-world scalability and reliability.

## Foundational AWS Projects (Pre-Terraform)

Before adopting Infrastructure as Code, I deployed multiple production-grade AWS architectures manually through the console.  
These projects provided a deep understanding of AWS service dependencies, security patterns, and design principles forming the foundation for my Terraform automation journey.
