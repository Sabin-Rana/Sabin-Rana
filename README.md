## Terraform Infrastructure Automation Journey

Completed a 10-day structured Terraform learning journey, automating end-to-end AWS infrastructure through Infrastructure as Code.  
This project represents my transition from manual AWS console deployments to fully automated, production-ready architectures.  

The implementation includes reusable Terraform modules, remote state management, CI/CD patterns, and security automation  demonstrating real-world scalability and reliability.  

**Repository:** [AWS Infrastructure Automation with Terraform](https://github.com/Sabin-Rana/terraform-learning-journey)

## Ongoing Projects

- **Enterprise AWS 3-Tier Architecture (Terraform Version)** ‚Äì *In Progress*  
  Automating enterprise-grade three-tier architecture using Terraform modules, RDS PostgreSQL, and GitHub Actions for CI/CD integration.  
  This project builds on my manual 3-tier implementation and focuses on modular design, cost optimization, and infrastructure automation.

## Foundational AWS Projects (Pre-Terraform)

Before adopting Infrastructure as Code, I deployed multiple production-grade AWS architectures manually through the console.  
These projects provided a deep understanding of AWS service dependencies, security patterns, and design principles forming the foundation for my Terraform automation journey.

### Enterprise 3-Tier Architecture
